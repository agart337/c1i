            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The story follows a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro, who, while moving to a new town, stumbles into a
                mysterious and magical world ruled by spirits, witches, and strange creatures. Her parents are
                transformed into pigs, and Chihiro must navigate this strange spirit realm to find a way to break the
                spell and save them. The film revolves around her journey as she navigates her way into adulthood,
                taking responsibility for herself and her parents.</p>
            <h2>Insight on the film</h2>
            <p> The title of *Spirited Away, “千と千尋の神隠し (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi),” translates to “Sen and
                Chihiro’s Spirited Away.” The term “神隠し (*Kamikakushi*)” conveys a unique Japanese feeling of someone
                being lost to the spirit world, blending mysticism and fear while revealing beauty and heightened
                awareness. The concept of Kamikakushi evokes a mystical and spiritual feeling, intertwined with fear.
                Chihiro exemplifies this transformation; at first, she's a moody child, unaware of her surroundings.
                However, as she enters the spirit world, she begins to observe her environment more keenly and undergoes
                personal growth. Ultimately, *Kamikakushi* embodies the sentiment of self-discovery, awareness of one's
                surroundings, and the exploration of the raw human experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                The film blurs reality and fantasy, merging past and present through the Japanese concept “雰囲気
                (Funiki),” which means atmosphere, mood, and ambience. Miyazaki’s focus on detail enhances the
                believability of settings and highlights overlooked beauty, creating emotionally resonant imagery. For
                instance, Chihiro’s initial fear of the Bathhouse transforms into appreciation upon her return,
                emphasizing her growth and deepening the emotional narrative. This is shown via shifting the art from
                every detail of the exterior being highlighted because she is experiencing it for the very first time
                and is scared to its beauty being highlighted more than its unfamiliarity, as she starts feeling
                confident. This attention to detail enhances the emotional depth of the narrative, making the setting an
                integral part of Chihiro's growth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Spirited Away* includes many moments that, while not pivotal to the plot, focus on small, intimate
                details—like Chihiro crying with Haku or the way she puts on her shoes. These scenes evoke a sense of
                timelessness and highlight the beauty of ordinary experiences. This approach reflects the Japanese
                concept of “間 (Ma),” representing the pauses before and after tension, allowing viewers to immerse
                themselves in the characters' world. These intervals diverge from typical story structures, encouraging
                us to ponder what lies beyond the narrative and to create our own interpretations. The film’s calm,
                observant moments are likened to watching rain while sipping tea; they reveal the subtle movements of
                life around us, fostering curiosity and personal reflection, and enabling us to connect with our own
                stories.
            </p>
            <h2>What I loved</h2>
            <p> What I like about many of Miyazaki's films is that there is no clear good vs evil dichotomy. They are
                very not American in this regard. Where Disney or Hollywood always provides a clear-cut villain, and
                there is a struggle by a hero to triumph over evil. In Miyazaki's films often these concepts
                interpenetrate each other; phenomena exist; it's not necessarily good or bad and the main hero seeks
                harmony, not triumph.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the movie maintains all the childhood wonder of discovering a fantastical world of spirits and
                gods, it also never groups its characters as good or bad — a characteristic of many childhood movies.
                Each character has their motivation at heart, each with their idea of good intentions. There is never a
                scene that feels like it was made only for children. The dialogue, the humour, and the characters all
                display a unique sense of realism and maturity that normally isn’t present in animated movies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kids don't act like kids in many movies. Spirited Away gets what kids are like in a way few movies do.
                They're complex, conflicted, selfish, selfless, enduring, tiring creatures. And that's how the
                protagonist of Spirited Away is portrayed. But it's more than that. Kids are willing to learn. They want
                to be better. In Spirited Away, we see Chihiro mature, become more introspective, observant, and learn
                how to deal with a complex dynamic of authority figures. You just don't see this in many other movies.
                It understands what being young is like.

            <h2>Brief on production</h2>
            <p> Art: Miyazaki’s works have a depth and complexity often missing in American animation. Not fond of
                computers, he draws thousands of frames himself, and there is a painterly richness in his work. He’s
                famous for throwaway details at the edges of the screen (animation is so painstaking that few animators
                draw more than is necessary). His drawing style descends from the classical Japanese graphic artists,
                with its subtle use of colors, clear lines, rich detail and its realistic depiction of fantastical
                elements. He suggests not just the appearances of his characters, but their natures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Director: Miyazaki starts by visualising and painting a picture that might come into his head. Even
                after having an idea about the story, he does not write it down because he feels that it would limit his
                creativity, and hence, he resolves to storyboards with short briefs about each scene. Miyazaki explains
                that the story flows and progresses by itself. Therefore, the whole focus remains on the visual aspect
                of the film rather than the dialogues. This deviation from traditional story-writing makes his films
                very special because it captures the core of visual storytelling, that is, breaking the language barrier
                and connecting with people through moving pictures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Music: [Hearing the soft piano melody of “One Summer’s
                Day” paired with the image of Chihiro leaving her
                adventure in the spirit world behind, permanently changed by her experiences there, conjures the feeling
                that you too, are leaving something behind. The music perfectly ties in the melancholic sentiment of
                growing up and the bittersweet realization that life will no longer be the way it once was when you were
                a child. It envelops you completely in the world Miyazaki has created.

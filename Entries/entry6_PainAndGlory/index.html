            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Salvador Mallo, a filmmaker in the twilight of his career, remembers his life: his mother, his lovers,
                and the actors he worked with. The sixties in a small village in Valencia, the eighties in Madrid, and
                the present, when he feels an immeasurable emptiness, facing his mortality, the incapability of
                continuing filming, the impossibility of separating creation from his own life. The need to narrate his
                past can be his salvation.</p>
            <h2>Insight on the film</h2>
            <p> While Almodóvar has denied that Pain and Glory is strictly autobiographical, he has referred to it as
                “the movie that is closest to me.” A storyline involving Mallo teaching a young man to read when he was
                a child is based on Almodóvar teaching several people who were in their teens and twenties how to read
                when he was a boy. Sentiments that Mallo expresses about his family are identical to those Almodóvar has
                expressed in interviews. Mallo even wears clothes that belong to Almodóvar. This film has such a
                personal quality to it that, after Almodóvar sent the script to his closest collaborators (including but
                not limited to Antonio Banderas and his younger brother Agustín Almodóvar), all of them reached out to
                him to make sure that he wasn’t suffering as much as Mallo does. 
            </p>
            <h2>What I loved</h2>
            <p> The British author Martin Amis once said in an interview that writers should divide their time on
                Earth into three roughly equal sections: reading, writing, and living. The implication is that being a
                sufficiently committed artist will cause you to miss out on two-thirds of life. *Pain and
                Glory* provides several moments in which we see how Salvador has maintained a necessary distance from
                experience to do what he does; further, we see that he has been keen to use whatever he does encounter
                for his art. (As the probably apocryphal Rodin quotation has it, “Nothing is a waste of time if you use
                the experience wisely.”)
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, when Alberto prepares to administer Salvador’s first hit of heroin, he says, “You must be
                doing research for something”—as if he can’t believe that Salvador would resort to drug use out of a
                personal need. Later, when Salvador’s ailing mother tells him about a dream she had about someone from
                their village, she stops short, noticing her son’s growing interest in what she’s saying, and snaps,
                “Don’t look at me with that narrator’s face!” She baulks at the idea that her son is using her, which—if
                you believe the content of the movie to be mostly autobiographical—is exactly what Salvador, or rather
                Almodóvar, is doing.

            <h2>Brief on production</h2>
            <p> Director: The most vivid episodes are flashbacks to the director’s youth, with a radiant Penélope Cruz
                as his mother and Asier Flores as her precocious son. These adoring vignettes stand out in sharp relief
                from the climactic scenes where Salvador engages his elderly mother in candid conversation. These
                moments are so achingly real that I felt like I was eavesdropping on a conversation I had no business
                hearing.
                <br>
                That’s Almodóvar for you. In interviews he has tried to distance himself from the character of Salvador,
                declaring that he and Pedro are not the same. Yet he has also said, “My life has indirectly found its
                way into every picture I’ve made, but *Pain and Glory* is the most representative of me. I have
                deposited in it everything that I own: my furniture, my paintings, my clothes, my intimacy, a few
                ghosts, my childhood memories, and my need to carry on making films as my only way of life.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Cinematography and colour theory: Pedro Almodóvar’s cinematography, guided by José Luis Alcaine's
                photography, uses color to express complex emotions. The film opens in blue, symbolizing melancholy and
                longing, and setting the emotional tone. Almodóvar uses blue as a backdrop for memory, loss, and
                absence. This contrasts with red, which embodies raw emotion and passion, creating a dialogue between
                the two colours. The cinematography reflects this emotional duality, with blue representing sadness and
                red representing the intensity of feeling.
                <br>
                Almodóvar’s films are known for their heightened, dreamlike visuals. Even in natural settings, the
                lighting feels staged, and the colour palette is vibrant, serving more as emotional cues than realistic
                representations. This visual approach, rich with symbolism and melodrama, creates a sense of artifice
                that emphasizes the emotional narrative.

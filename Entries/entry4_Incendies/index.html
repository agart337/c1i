            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>After the death of their mother, the Marwan twins in Montreal are called to the office of her employer.
                She had gone to work for him some 20 years ago after escaping sectarian violence and rage in a nation
                not unlike Lebanon. She left for her children; they learned two letters. Jeanne is asked to give hers to
                the father they never knew. Simon is told to give his to a brother they didn’t know they had. Adapted
                from Wajdi Mouawad’s acclaimed play, Incendies tells the powerful and moving tale of two young adults’
                voyage to the core of deep-rooted hatred, never-ending wars and enduring love. </p>
            <h2>Insight on the film</h2>
            <p> As Martin Heidegger points out, our heritage is constitutive to our being. In his “Being and Time,” he
                writes that man is essentially his own past, and that his manner of existing implies the interpretation
                of himself, and of that very past that at times affects him. In other words, the twins’ search for the
                truth about their father and brother and their own past is essentially the search for who they are.
                <br>
                <br>
                Their interpretation of themselves profoundly changes when they find out that they have a brother and a
                father who are alive. When this truth is brought to light, their identity needs to be reshaped and
                rebuilt. The movie may be compared to a pilgrimage of a sort, a quest for revelation and the definition
                of one’s true self. This revelation is followed by suffering and trauma; it is a dangerous journey into
                the unknown where the very conception of one’s self is put into question, and is damaged and longs to be
                healed.
            </p>
            <h2>What I loved</h2>
            <p> From the moment Radiohead’s ‘You and Whose Army?’ trills over the opening sequence of a young boy
                having his head shaved – shooting daggers through the screen into my tender teenage soul – I was hooked.
                <br>
                <br>
                This movie wasn't something I could relate to, but I found myself empathising and grieving with the
                characters as the story unfolded. The Middle East was, and remains to this day, a region divided by
                in-fighting and political unrest. As a teenager, I knew that there was violence surrounding me, wars and
                disputes that I would gloss over in the Gulf News en route to the culture section, but I never
                appreciated the extent or proximity of the destruction.
                <br>
                <br>
                The way that Incendies’ plot unfolds, and the way in which the twins are positioned as foreign
                outsiders, forced to come face-to-face with Arab culture, mirrored my own uncomfortable re-assessment of
                the world I live in. It was dangerous, angry, and bitterly divided.

            <h2>Brief on production</h2>
            <p> Director: Villeneuve first attended "Incendies,'' known in English as "Scorched,'' without any
                professional motive. But "I was astonished by the power of the story. I went out of the theatre knowing
                I would do a film of it.''
                Staged minimally, the play conjured snipers, assassinations and bloody reprisals entirely with dialogue.
                The movie makes the violence graphic, notably during a merciless attack on a bus full of women and
                children. Yet the filmmaker "tried to keep the mythic quality," he says. "That's what I loved in the
                play, was the
                equilibrium between modernity and a Greek tragedy.''
                <br>
                <br>
                Screenplay (MacGuffin's storytelling technique): Mouawad's story follows two adult Lebanese Canadian
                twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon
                (Maxim Gaudette), as they obey directives in their mother's will. The document leads Jeanne, and
                ultimately Simon, from Montreal to Lebanon, where they learn things about their mother that she had
                never confided.
                "Mouawad used both twins to show us the two reactions people can have to the past,'' the director says.
                "Simon thinks you can live in the present without thinking about the past. And Jeanne instinctively
                thinks that she has to know, to grow up.''
                Although Villeneuve's script trims much of Mouawad's language, the director recognizes that the movie
                remains "very theatrical . . . it flirts with melodrama all the time." He even considered making
                "Incendies'' as a silent movie. "In order to be really faithful, in a way, to Mouawad's poetry, the
                perfect way would be to make a film without words at all. Just images inspired by his words."
                <br>
                <br>
                Cinematography: Villeneuve said in an interview: “It was important that there was a relationship between
                the landscapes
                and the inner feelings of the characters walking through them. I tried never to fall into the trap of
                exoticism.” This particular connection is vivid throughout the movie, most importantly in the scenes set
                in the Middle East, where desolation and destructed cities amplify the feelings of the protagonist.
                <br>
                The destruction of material objects shows the condition of the human psyche confronted with violence
                which may seem never-ending.
                <br>
                When Jeanne comes to the Middle East, the setting is peaceful; the birds are singing and the trees
                surrounding them are per her peace of mind, which is still not disturbed by evil. When she finds out her
                mother was raped in prison, the wind is howling and we can feel her disturbance mirrored in the changed
                character of the landscape.
                <br>
                When the horrendous truth about the parentage of twins is discovered, we see Jeanne in a hallway where
                there is little room, indicating that she feels trapped. While Chamseddine is telling them who their
                father is, at first we can see the endless sand landscapes and dark woods covered in snow, both telling
                us about the vastness of feelings and confusion that the twins are going through. Nevertheless, the
                peaceful music is playing, indicating that they have found peace at last.

            date</div>
        <br>
        <div class="review">The steely elegance of Villeneuve’s emphatic camera movements and framing are as much of the
            “story” as the terrors past unearthed by two grown, yet innocent children</div>
        <br>
        <div class="review">A powerful, atmospheric drama</div>
        <br>
        <div class="review">Watching Incendies is a long, hard, and emotionally draining experience but one that richly
            rewards the time and effort invested</div>
        <br>
